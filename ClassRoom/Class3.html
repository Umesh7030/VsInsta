                History of Charminar
            </header>
            <section>
                <p>Charminar was built by Sultan Mohammed Quli Qutb Shah in 1591. It is said that this square shaped structure with four pillars and intricate carvings was built in honour of his wife, Bhagmati. However, the actual reason behind building Charminar is still not clear.</p>
                <p>As per a popular belief, Charminar was built to acknowledge the elimination of the plague which had affected the entire city immensely during that era. It is believed that the Sultan had prayed for the end of this plague with which his people were suffering. Hence, as the plague ended, he built the charminar as a tribute to Allah. The four pillars are also said to be dedicated to the first four caliphs of Islam.</p>
                <p>It is also said that it was built in the memory of Prophet Muhammed’s son in law who lost his life at the battle of Karbala as its design is in the shape of Shiya Tazias. Some also believe that the location of Charminar is the place where Sultan had seen his then future wife Bahgmati for the first time.</p>
                <P>There is another legend associated with the Charminar according to which, there is a secret underground tunnel that connects Charminar to the Golconda Fort. It was built for the royal family, to escape in case of any kind of emergencies. However, till date no tunnel could be found.</P>
                <h4>Architecture of Charminar</h4>
                <p>An Iranian architect Mir Momin Astrawadi, who had settled in Hyderabad, designed Charminar. It presents an imposing structure which has clearly withstood the test of time. It is a square shaped monument with four pillars, one on each side. The architectural design of Charminar is inspired from the Shia “tazias”. These Tazias were built in the memory of Hussain, who was the son in law of Prophet Muhhamed and had lost his life in the battle of Karbala.</p>
                <p>The square shape of the monument measures 20 meters on each side. Each side of the monument is 11 meter wide and overlooks the four prominent thoroughfares. Charminar has been built with granite and lime mortar.</p>
